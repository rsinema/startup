# Elevator Pitch for Startup

Are you sick of Instagram and Facebook with the needless amounts of ads, toxicity, and too many distracting features? The PicShare application takes all of the complexity out of sharing photos with your peers and simply allows you to post pictures you want and see your friends' pictures. Search for your friends on the app and add them to see their pictures and have them see yours. This app is all about just being able to share your photos to share them.
